          <p>
            Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the
            environment. These harmful materials are called "pollutants". Although
            environmental pollution can be caused by natural events such as
            forest fires and active volcanoes, use of the word "pollution"
            generally implies that the contaminants have an anthropogenic
            source—that is, a source created by human activities. Pollution has
            accompanied humankind ever since groups of people first congregated
            and remained for a long time in any one place. Indeed, ancient human
            settlements are frequently recognized by their wastes—shell mounds
            and rubble heaps, for instance. Pollution was not a serious problem
            as long as there was enough space available for each individual or
            group. However, with the establishment of permanent settlements by
            great numbers of people, pollution became a problem, and it has
            remained one ever since.</p>
            
            <p>Effects of pollution on the Earth include environmental
            deterioration, impacts on the health of living organisms, global
            warming, depletion of the ozone layer and reduced efficiency or
            infertility of farm lands and crop fields. The sources of pollution
            vary widely, and so do its effects. Pollution affects all areas of
            the Earth, including the water, soil and atmosphere, on microscopic
            and macroscopic levels, causing immediate harm or long-term damage.Environmental degradation is among the primary negative impacts of
            pollution on the Earth. This includes a decline in air and water
            quality, which is caused by the introduction of harmful toxins and
            pollutants. These substances do not generally biodegrade. Instead,
            they linger in water and the air and disrupt natural processes. One
            negative effect of air pollution is the addition of surplus amounts
            of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This creates levels of dense
            smog, which may prevent sunlight from reaching the earth. In turn,
            this diminishes the ability of plants to carry out the
            life-supporting process of photosynthesis. Pollution also reduces
            air quality, which has detrimental effects on humans and animals by
            causing respiratory irritation and asthma. Lastly, pollution in the
            form of insecticides and pesticides may interfere with the growth of
            crops and introduce toxins into key water sources.</p>
