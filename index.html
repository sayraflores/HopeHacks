            Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the
            environment. These harmful materials are called pollutants.Although
            environmental pollution can be caused by natural events such as
            forest fires and active volcanoes, use of the word pollution
            generally implies that the contaminants have an anthropogenic
            source—that is, a source created by human activities. Pollution has
            accompanied humankind ever since groups of people first congregated
            and remained for a long time in any one place. Indeed, ancient human
            settlements are frequently recognized by their wastes—shell mounds
            and rubble heaps, for instance. Pollution was not a serious problem
            as long as there was enough space available for each individual or
            group. However, with the establishment of permanent settlements by
            great numbers of people, pollution became a problem, and it has
            remained one ever since. Effects of pollution on the Earth include
            environmental deterioration, impacts on the health of living
            organisms, global warming, depletion of the ozone layer and reduced
            efficiency or infertility of farm lands and crop fields. The sources
            of pollution vary widely, and so do its effects. Pollution affects
            all areas of the Earth, including the water, soil and atmosphere, on
            microscopic and macroscopic levels, causing immediate harm or
            long-term damage. Environmental degradation is among the primary
            negative impacts of pollution on the Earth. This includes a decline
            in air and water quality, which is caused by the introduction of
            harmful toxins and pollutants. These substances do not generally
            biodegrade. Instead, they linger in water and the air and disrupt
            natural processes. One negative effect of air pollution is the
            addition of surplus amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
            This creates levels of dense smog, which may prevent sunlight from
            reaching the earth. In turn, this diminishes the ability of plants
            to carry out the life-supporting process of photosynthesis.
            Pollution also reduces air quality, which has detrimental effects on
            humans and animals by causing respiratory irritation and asthma.
            Lastly, pollution in the form of insecticides and pesticides may
            interfere with the growth of crops and introduce toxins into key
            water sources.
